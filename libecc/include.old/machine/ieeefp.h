/* This file can define macros to choose variations of the IEEE float
   format:

   _FLT_LARGEST_EXPONENT_IS_NORMAL

	Defined if the float format uses the largest exponent for finite
	numbers rather than NaN and infinity representations.  Such a
	format cannot represent NaNs or infinities at all, but it's FLT_MAX
	is twice the IEEE value.

   _FLT_NO_DENORMALS

	Defined if the float format does not support IEEE denormals.  Every
	float with a zero exponent is taken to be a zero representation.
 
   ??? At the moment, there are no equivalent macros above for doubles and
   the macros are not fully supported by --enable-newlib-hw-fp.

   __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN

        Defined if the float format is big endian.  This is mutually exclusive
        with __IEEE_LITTLE_ENDIAN.

   __IEEE_LITTLE_ENDIAN
 
        Defined if the float format is little endian.  This is mutually exclusive
        with __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN.

   Note that one of __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN or __IEEE_LITTLE_ENDIAN must be specified for a
   platform or error will occur.

   __IEEE_BYTES_LITTLE_ENDIAN

        This flag is used in conjunction with __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN to describe a situation 
	whereby multiple words of an IEEE floating point are in big endian order, but the
	words themselves are little endian with respect to the bytes.

   _DOUBLE_IS_32BITS 

        This is used on platforms that support double by using the 32-bit IEEE
        float type.

   _FLOAT_ARG

        This represents what type a float arg is passed as.  It is used when the type is
        not promoted to double.
